1. Is a beginning farmer's business likely to succeed? 
    1. I worked on a small farm: < 5 acres; < 10 workers; < $250,000 income. By gathering data on certain metrics I would like to generate models that predict if these farmers will succeed.
    2. Predict likelihood of success for beginning farmers in US based on metrics like funding, years experience, education, supplemental income, individual or partnership
    3. Other features to consider: location, race
    4. Data resources:
        1. [USDA: agriculture prices](https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/c821gj76b?locale=en)
    6. Parameters to limit research: farmers farming on < 100 acres; income < $500,000; < 15 workers
    7. Success baromoter: are they still farming after 5 years?

2. Are town/local government officials representative of the population living there?
    1. What makes a town's government more or less representative of the population?
    2. Gather demographic data; gather data on local representation
    3. Determine other features that could be relevant to who local officials are (town political trends, proximity to big cities, state located in, etc.). Gather data and include in research. 

3. What determines musician/band success?
    1. Do artist stories/backgrounds have significanct impact on their success?
    2. Looking at specific types of musicians v. generally famous people
